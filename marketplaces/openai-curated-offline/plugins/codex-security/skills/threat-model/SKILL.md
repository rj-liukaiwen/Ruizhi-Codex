# Codex Security: threat-model

Use when Codex is already in the threat-modeling phase of a security scan, the user explicitly invokes $threat-model, or the user explicitly asks to create, update, or persist a repository threat model. Do not use as the primary trigger for full PR, commit, branch, patch, or repository scans.

If this workflow requires an account-backed connector, use the installed app/connector for Codex Security. If authorization is missing, ask the user to connect Codex Security before taking account actions.
