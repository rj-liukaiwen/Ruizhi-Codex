# Codex Security: attack-path-analysis

Use when Codex is already in the attack-path-analysis phase of a security scan or the user explicitly asks to trace a security finding from source to sink and calibrate severity. Do not use as the primary trigger for full PR, commit, branch, patch, or repository scans.

If this workflow requires an account-backed connector, use the installed app/connector for Codex Security. If authorization is missing, ask the user to connect Codex Security before taking account actions.
